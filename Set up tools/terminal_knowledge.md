# Terminal Knowledge

## Reflections

I chose iTerm2 after reading a few opinions about it on Reddit.  
I changed the appearance in terms of colors and font sizes.  
I also used Oh My Zsh to further customize the shell.

I refreshed some basic terminal commands like ls to show a list of files and cd to change directories to navigate around the terminal.
