# Competitive Landscape

## Reflections

Unlike other apps, Focus Bear provides flexibility in choosing the level of blocking while also incorporating AI-powered app sensing, which differentiates it from the competition. Since Focus Bear is developed by a neurodivergent team, it is designed to better support other neurodivergent individuals—for example, by detecting hyperfocus and suggesting breaks accordingly.

As an end user, particularly someone who is neurodivergent, I would prefer Focus Bear over other apps because it is specifically designed for people with ADHD and ASD. Additionally, its high device compatibility and ability to track focus across multiple devices make it a strong choice.

Cold Turkey’s complete blocker, which prevents any cheating or procrastination, is a useful feature. Freedom also allows users to block specific categories such as search engines and music. While Focus Bear’s AI-powered blocking is similar, expanding its categorization options could improve its effectiveness.

Adding more customization options and an improved user interface could help Focus Bear stand out even further.
