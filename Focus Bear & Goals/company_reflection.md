## Reflections

Focus Bear was initially created as a personal project by Jeremy but has evolved into an application designed to help neurodivergent individuals manage their time better and stick to their habits.

The app primarily supports neurodivergent individuals, including those with AuDHD, as well as anyone who struggles with distractions and executive functioning.

This mission is crucial because it helps neurodivergent individuals who often find traditional productivity tools ineffective. By providing a structured approach to time management and habit formation, Focus Bear enables users to organize their lives more effectively and enhance their overall well-being.

As someone who values accessibility and has close friends diagnosed with ADHD, I understand their struggles firsthand. Contributing to solutions that address these challenges aligns with my personal values. Additionally, since we are also developing a mobile app, Focus Bear's work aligns with my technical interests as well.

Recently, I met someone diagnosed with both ADHD and OCD. During an in-depth conversation, they shared that one of their biggest challenges was time management and completing tasks despite meticulous planning. When I mentioned Focus Bear to them, they were genuinely excited about the work the team is doing and even provided a few suggestions on how they could better utilize the application.
