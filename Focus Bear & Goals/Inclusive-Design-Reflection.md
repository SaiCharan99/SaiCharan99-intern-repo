# Inclusive Design Reflection

## Reflections

I would adjust my communication style by avoiding ambiguity and large dumps of information, instead providing more structured and concise content that is easier to understand. I would also try to listen more and avoid interrupting others. When speaking, I would ensure a slow and patient manner to enhance clarity.

User Experience (UX) is crucial in providing a smooth experience, especially when catering to neurodivergent users. Having a simple and easy-to-understand interface, rather than a cluttered and overwhelming one, is highly beneficial. Using intuitive navigation is more supportive than attempting novel approaches that may confuse users.

One practical change I would make to better support vulnerable populations is to personally practice more patience while communicating with others. Additionally, while working on Focus Bear, I would aim to reduce cognitive load by implementing simplified and illustrative designs to enhance intuitiveness.

#### Key Observations

- All data should be in a single place rather than split across different applications, as it becomes difficult to keep track.
- _Planner Pad_ is a popular tool that follows a funnel-down planning system with three phases:
  - **Categorize** – Assign categories to each task.
  - **Prioritize** – Schedule tasks and assign priorities.
  - **Schedule** – Allocate detailed timing to activities.

This concept could be applied to Focus Bear to create a similar to-do list experience.

### Design/Communication Improvement to Enhance Accessibility

I suggest making the sliders more illustrative. For instance, when adjusting the _current mood_ slider, it could visually transition from a sad face at the beginning to a happy face at the end, with a color gradient from red to green to improve intuitiveness. Similar animations could be incorporated for other UI elements.

The slider was during the app onboarding, attached below is something similar in the app:-

Here, when we move the slider, we can add a small emoticon above the description or change the bear logo from the basic green (super gentle) to red as we move it to the right, with the logo changing to match the intensity.

### Writing Response Practice

Hi "User",

Hope you're having a great day!

Thanks for taking the time to reach out for help. Seeking support is the first step toward success and growth. I’ve been in similar situations, and I wouldn’t be where I am today without the help of others.

I recommend using Focus Bear’s reminder tools to better plan your tasks and stay on track with your goals. Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions, no matter how small.

Best regards,  
Sai
