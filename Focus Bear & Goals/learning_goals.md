# Learning Goals

## Reflections

I hope to gain experience working in a startup environment and understand how a team functions in this setting, particularly while developing for neurodivergent consumers using a Kanban board.

I am most excited to enhance my React Native experience in a Kanban-based workflow and adapt to a fast-paced work culture.

I can contribute my experience as a React Native developer by writing efficient and well-structured code. Additionally, I can provide suggestions to improve the user experience.

I feel less confident in software architecture and deployment aspects of a product and want to learn more about these areas.

Success in this internship would mean contributing to the development of meaningful features while also gaining extensive React Native experience along with a deeper understanding of software architecture.
