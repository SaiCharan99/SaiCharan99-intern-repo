# Git Knowledge

## Reflections

I have used Git before while working, primarily to pull the latest branch changes, commit, push my changes, and perform other related activities.

I was using Git in VS Code to get more comfortable with the commands. I wasnâ€™t very familiar with Git Desktop before, but now I have been introduced to it and learned how to resolve conflicts using it.
