# AI Usage Guidelines

## Reflections

AI should be used moderately in scenarios where one is stuck and unable to get initial help, as well as for learning about specific topics. However, for important situations involving decision-making, sensitive information, or personal experiences, one’s own skills must be applied.

To avoid over-reliance on AI, we should first apply our individual skills and expertise to solve problems. AI should only be used when truly needed—to gain an idea, not to obtain the entire solution.

To ensure data privacy, I will avoid entering sensitive or confidential data into AI tools. I will also double-check AI-generated solutions to ensure their accuracy in the given context. Additionally, I will follow the company’s AI policies to maintain compliance and security.

### AI Scenario: Drafting Professional Emails Without Grammar Mistakes

### Review and Analysis

AI-generated content is often too formal and robotic in tone. It may require adjustments to personalize the message or fine-tune it based on my previous emails. However, AI is useful for quickly drafting emails, allowing me to focus more on actual work.

### Best Practice

Always double-check AI-generated content and apply it only if appropriate. Use personal judgment to ensure clarity, tone, and accuracy align with the intended message.
