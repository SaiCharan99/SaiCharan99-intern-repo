# OHS Laptop Ergonomics

## Reflections

Adjusting my chair's height and using a laptop stand would improve my workspace setup and help straighten my back while working.

Adjusting the screen height and ensuring I sit upright regularly will improve my posture. Additionally, taking regular breaks and stretching will support better physical and postural health. Of course, I will use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks.

### Workspace Changes Made

- Started using a laptop stand to ensure the screen is at eye level.
- Adjusted chair height to match the screen level.
