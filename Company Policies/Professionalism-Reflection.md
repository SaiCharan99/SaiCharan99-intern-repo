# Professionalism Reflection

## Reflections

Yes, I have witnessed great teamwork and professionalism in my previous workplace at Publicis Sapient. This was made possible through clear and effective communication among team members, individuals being accountable for their tasks, and everyone maintaining a positive mindset and outlook.

I personally believe that taking time to think before speaking and always communicating with respect is crucial. When we speak slowly and thoughtfully, we naturally tune our minds to listen better.

I can contribute to creating a positive, fun, and professional work environment by building better rapport with my teammates. Disagreements and differing viewpoints are bound to happen, but they can be overcome by maintaining a positive and open mindset, actively listening, and working toward solutions together.
