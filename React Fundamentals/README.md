# React with Tailwind CSS Setup

## Steps Followed to Set Up the Environment

1. `npx create-react-app my-react-tailwind-app` to create the React project.
2. `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`. Autoprefixer is used for adding prefixes automatically to CSS, ensuring it works across different browsers. PostCSS integrates Autoprefixer into the build pipeline, allowing Tailwind to work optimally.
3. `npx tailwindcss init` to create the configuration files.
4. Modified `src/index.css` by adding `@tailwind` directives.
5. Created `postcss.config.js` with the necessary PostCSS setup.
6. Adjusted the Tailwind `content` in `tailwind.config.js` to include React components.
7. Ran the project with `npm start`.
