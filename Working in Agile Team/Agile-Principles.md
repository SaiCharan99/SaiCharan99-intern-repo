# Agile Principles

## Reflections

Agile offers great adaptability and fixed-length sprints to teams while also providing clearly defined roles to avoid inconsistencies and confusion related to scope. There is continuous feedback, which allows for constant improvement in the process. However, ensuring flexibility can be challenging, especially in a startup with a dynamic work environment.

### The 4 Agile Principles are:-
#### Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
#### Working software over comprehensive documentation.
#### Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
#### Responding to change over following a plan.


Agile principles, with their clearly outlined roles and responsibilities, eliminate ambiguity regarding tasks. Through retrospectives and other related ceremonies, Agile ensures that work remains aligned with goals and delivers value efficiently.

The main difference between Scrum and Kanban is that Scrum follows a rigid, time-based approach, whereas Kanban is more dynamic, flexible, and flow-based.

One key Agile principle that is most useful in my work is:  
**"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"**  
Continuous feedback and customer involvement ensure we receive the right input, make the product meet actual needs, and are essential for its success.
