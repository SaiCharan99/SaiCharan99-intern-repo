# Agile Ceremonies

## Reflections

Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment by providing constant feedback through retrospectives, tracking the status of all team members via stand-up meetings, and ensuring work is well-defined and prioritized through backlog refinement.

As a developer, daily stand-ups are crucial as they provide a platform to address any blockers I might be facing and to stay updated on the teamâ€™s progress, ensuring I am not left in the dark.

### One Change to Improve Team Collaboration

I will ensure blockers are clearly noted on the Kanban board and actively listen during stand-ups so that I can assist others if they face issues I have encountered before.
