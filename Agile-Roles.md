# Agile Roles

## Reflections

My role is that of a developer, specifically a React Native mobile app developer. I contribute to the Agile process by creating and developing working software. Additionally, I participate in Agile ceremonies like stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint planning to provide feedback and align with the team.

My role frequently overlaps with the Product Manager to gain a better understanding of the requirements, UX designers to ensure the expected user flow is implemented correctly, and QA to identify and resolve bugs.

My role fits into the Agile team by converting requirements and UX designs into working software, which is then tested by QA before being delivered to end users. It also plays a crucial part in the continuous feedback loop, helping improve the team's efficiency.

To improve teamwork with QA, I will discuss edge cases with them to perform initial unit testing and maintain open communication to quickly resolve any issues that arise.
