# AI Tools

## Reflections

I tried GitHub Copilot and used its inline chat feature to generate sample code.  
I also used Copilot Chat for brainstorming solutions.

Additionally, I tried ChatGPT and Claude.

These tools are really useful for quickly fixing minor errors, such as syntax issues, that we might face. However, they are not ideal for obtaining entire code solutions, as they tend to make mistakes and do not provide much learning for us.

Sample code generated by copilot:-

```javascript
function addTwoNumbers(a, b) {
  return a + b
}
```
