# Cyber Security Guidelines

## Reflections

Cybersecurity is key when using any digital device, especially in a work environment. I currently follow basic measures such as locking my device when I step away, using strong passwords without writing them down, and utilizing a VPN when working on public networks.

Additionally, I will be more vigilant in scrutinizing emails to avoid phishing attacks and will consider using a password manager like 1Password to securely store all my passwords.

By being extra cautious of emails and periodic password changes.

By using password managers and autofilling strong passwords suggested.

Immediately report the incident, similar to how Jermey showed a provioius intern reached out to him. Also change any related passwords.

One new cyber secuity habit would be to start using the password manager application.
