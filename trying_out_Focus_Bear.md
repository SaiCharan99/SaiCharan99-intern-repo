# Trying Out Focus Bear

## Reflections

The app doesn't feel polished enough. I tried it on my Mac first, and the UI could be further refined. There are too many questions initially, with less flexibility. For example, I might study in the morning and evening, but the app only allows one time window to be chosen.

The UI is a bit overwhelming, with too many questions, which makes it difficult to understand at first.

However, it seems like a focus-improving application.

It would be better with a more polished UI and the option to skip questions, allowing users to complete the setup later.
