# Kanban Workflow

## Reflections

Kanban helps manage priorities by visualizing the entire workload and ensuring transparency. Overload is avoided by limiting WIP (Work in Progress). Kanban also allows breaking down big features into smaller tasks, making it easier to track progress and reducing the overall workload.

Clear requirements and limited WIP can effectively improve my workflow. Regularly updating tasks ensures transparency and keeps everyone aligned.

Kanban Board: [GitHub Projects - Focus Bear](https://github.com/orgs/Focus-Bear/projects/5)
Created own Kanban board to make changes:-

By regularly updating the Kanban board with the current status, I can improve task tracking and maintain workflow efficiency.
