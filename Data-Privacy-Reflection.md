# Data Privacy Reflection

## Reflections

### Confidential Data:

Confidential data includes identification data, social data, professional data, commercial and marketing data, financial data, profile data, and special categories of personal data.

### Ensuring Secure Data Handling:

To ensure I handle data securely in my daily tasks, I would:

- Only collect essential data and promote data minimization.
- Ensure two-factor authentication (2FA) is enabled on devices to prevent vulnerabilities.

### Storing and Disposing of Sensitive Information:

- Sensitive information should always be encrypted when stored, and codewords must be used for sensitive data like health and religious beliefs. Generic identifiers should be used for such information as well.
- Disposal of sensitive information is crucial. Irrecoverable deletion should be performed when the information is no longer required. Data retention policies must be followed, and clear rules for when to delete data must be adhered to.
- The physical destruction of sensitive data should be done securely, such as shredding, to make it non-recoverable.

### Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:

- Failure to obtain proper consent: This can be resolved by obtaining explicit consent before collecting or processing data.
- Not updating data regularly: Keeping data up to date is important to ensure users receive accurate and relevant information. Regular updates should be implemented.
- Not having a data breach plan: To mitigate damage, a step-by-step plan for notifying affected parties should be developed and followed.

### One Habit to Improve Data Security:

Not using the same password across all websites and regularly updating passwords for different websites reduces the impact of data breaches.

### Security Measure:

I will start using a password manager like 1Password as the first step to organize and securely manage passwords.
